  <p>This super lush and Creamy Pesto Chicken Pasta is perfect for
  busy weeknights. Everything cooks in one pot and is done in
  <strong>under 30 minutes</strong>!</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breast</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp butter</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1/2 lb. penne pasta</li>
    <li>1.5 cups chicken broth</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>3 oz. cream cheese</li>
    <li>1/3 cup basil pesto</li>
    <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan</li>
    <li>freshly cracked pepper</li>
    <li>1 pinch crushed red pepper</li>
    <li>3 cup fresh spinach</li>
    <li>1/4 cup sliced sun dried tomatoes</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Cut the chicken breast into 1-inch pieces. Add the butter
    to a deep skillet and melt over medium heat. Add the chicken to
    the skillet and cook over medium heat until the chicken is
    slightly browned on the outside.</li>
    <li>While the chicken is cooking, mince the garlic. Add the
    garlic to the skillet with the chicken and continue to saut√©
    for one minute more.</li>
    <li>Add the uncooked pasta and chicken broth to the skillet
    with the chicken and garlic. Stir to dissolve any browned bits
    from the bottom of the skillet. Place a lid on the skillet,
    turn the heat up to medium-high, and bring the broth up to a
    boil.</li>
    <li>Once the broth comes to a full boil, give the pasta a quick
    stir, replace the lid, and turn the heat down to medium-low.
    Let the pasta simmer over medium-low heat for about 8 minutes,
    or until the pasta is tender and most of the broth has been
    absorbed. Stir the pasta briefly every two minutes as it
    simmers, replacing the lid quickly each time.</li>
    <li>Once the pasta is tender and most of the broth absorbed,
    add the milk, cream cheese (cut into chunks), and pesto. Stir
    and cook over medium heat until the cream cheese has fully
    melted into the sauce. Finally, add the grated Parmesan and
    stir until combined.</li>
    <li>If using, add the fresh spinach and sliced sun dried
    tomatoes. Stir until the spinach has wilted, then remove the
    pasta from the heat. Top the pasta with freshly cracked pepper
    and a pinch of crushed red pepper, then serve.</li>
  </ol>
